Making a Charles Darwin zombie shooter with Robert Winslow.

This game was masterminded by Ruair√≠ Sinkler and Robert Winslow based on the theme of evolution. In the game you play as Charles Darwin who is exploring the Galapagos islands when a zombie outbreak strikes and the crew of the Beagle aren't man enough to stand up and fight. Charles Darwin must now show these zombies the true meaning of survival of the fittest, Darwin style.
